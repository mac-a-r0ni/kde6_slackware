This is a fork of AlienBOBs 'ktown' repo for
latest & greatest KDE on Slackware-current systems.
https://alien.slackbook.org/ktown/

This project has been spearheaded by LuckyCyborg and info can be found here:

This fork on github is a fork of a fork, basically. I follow things being done and try to integrate it here for building on aarch64,
but also change and make my own attempts at improvements. In spirit, it's all one big project made with love for the community!

Please let me know if anything is missing, or any optional things you'd like to see added.

I aim to completely replace Slackware's /kde directory. This includes replacing Plasma 5 with 6
and all supplimental applications. Please see the REMOVE_PKGS file in this folder for
the packages not existing in this set.

I intend to ship every possible package which existed in KDE5 with a direct
replacement from KDE6. Other packages from /l & /n will be supplimented when qt6 libs
are needed by a package with a "-qt6" suffixed name. This way, intrusion into your system
is minimal, as only the /kde directory needs replacing and maintaining.
