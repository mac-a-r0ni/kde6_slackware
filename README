This is a fork of AlienBOBs 'ktown' repo for
latest & greatest KDE on Slackware-current systems.
https://alien.slackbook.org/ktown/

This project has been spearheaded by LuckyCyborg and info can be found here:

This fork on github is a fork of a fork, basically. I follow things being done and try to integrate it here for building on aarch64,
but also change and make my own attempts at improvements. In spirit, it's all one big project made with love for the community!

Keep Slackware KDE packages:

fcitx5-configtool
fcitx5-theme-breeze
latte-dock

Please let me know if anything is missing, or any optional things you'd like to see added.
