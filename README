This is a fork of AlienBOBs 'ktown' repo for
latest & greatest KDE on Slackware-current systems.
https://alien.slackbook.org/ktown/

This project has been spearheaded by LuckyCyborg and info can be found 
here:
https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/building-the-plasma6-for-slackware-current-in-the-ktown-style-a-build-based-on-the-alienbob%27s-ktown-4175735773/

I am not associated with the work they do, nor am I with Slackware 
itself. I enjoy Slackware, and just hope to contribute something 
useful to the community. If there's a bug with something you found 
here, please submit a issue or a PR. I do my best to keep in sync 
with the changes on current but as with any downstream project, 
expect some occasional delays.

This fork on github is a fork of a fork, basically. I follow things 
being done and try to integrate it here for building on aarch64,
but also change and make my own attempts at improvements. In spirit, 
it's all one big project made with love for the community!

Please let me know if anything is missing, or any optional things you'd 
like to see added.

I aim to completely replace Slackware's /kde directory. This includes
replacing Plasma 5 with 6 and all supplimental applications. Please see 
the REMOVE_PKGS file in this folder for the packages no longer existing 
in this set.

Recently, I'd removed the 'ffmpeg4' vlc-compat package and it's now 
recommended to use AlienBob's static VLC package instead. No reason to re-
invent the wheel, but I have done a few edits so it builds on arm64 as well.

As of Gear 25.04 the OCR engine 'tesseract' is now required for 'skanpage'. 
I've included the English training data, but if you require another 
language you are to provide your own. Differing languages can be found 
here:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata

There are slackpkg+ repos for both x86_64/arm64 slackware-current systems 
available on my website here: https://slackware.lngn.net/

Also, I periodically put an updated liveslak available here:
