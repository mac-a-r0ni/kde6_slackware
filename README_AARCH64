Differences between LuckyCyborg's x86_64 package set and my aarch64 are:

deps/ -
I've directly included mpv and it's deps as well as ddcutil and
cmark which directly lets me ship neochat (matrix client) and
tokodon (mastodon client) along with the rest of the packages.

Recently I added a 'ffmpeg4' package for VLC to use, since
much of VLC does not work with ffmpeg-7.0 yet. VLC is built off only
the included deps within Slackware. No extra libraries are supported
within this package.

I've also kept the KDE packages in the subdirs of which the script
places them upon building. You don't have to install all 300+
packages to get a working desktop, but you're on your own if you
go down that path. I'd recommend doing:

upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall *.txz

with your selection of packages. I do recommend a full installation.
Also, all scripts have been edited to properly build on x86_64 or
aarch64 systems.

As always, Have fun!
