# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kconfig-5: KConfig provides an advanced configuration system. It is made of two
kconfig-5: parts: KConfigCore and KConfigGui. KConfigCore provides access to the
kconfig-5: configuration files themselves. KConfigGui provides a way to hook
kconfig-5: widgets to the configuration so that they are automatically
kconfig-5: initialized from the configuration and automatically propagate their
kconfig-5: changes to their respective configuration files.
