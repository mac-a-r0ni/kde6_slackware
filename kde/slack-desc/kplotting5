# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kplotting5: kplotting5 (Data plotting)
kplotting5:
kplotting5: KPlotWidget is a QWidget-derived class that provides a virtual base
kplotting5: class for easy data-plotting. The idea behind KPlotWidget is that you
kplotting5: only have to specify information in data units; i.e., the natural
kplotting5: units of the data being plotted. KPlotWidget automatically converts
kplotting5: everything to screen pixel units. KPlotWidget draws X and Y axes with
kplotting5: tick marks and tick labels, and automatically determines how many tick
kplotting5: marks to use and where they should be, based on the data limits
kplotting5: specified for the plot.
