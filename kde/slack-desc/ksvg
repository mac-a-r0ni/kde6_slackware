# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ksvg:
ksvg: A library for rendering SVG-based themes with stylesheet re-coloring
ksvg: and on-disk caching.
ksvg: KSvg provides both C++ classes and QtQuick components to render svgs
ksvg: based on image packs. Compared to plain QSvg, it caches the rendered
ksvg: images on disk with KImageCache, and can re-color properly crafted
ksvg: svg shapes that include internal stylesheets.
