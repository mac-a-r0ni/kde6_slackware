# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kio-5:
kio-5: This framework implements almost all the file management functions you
kio-5: will ever need. In fact, the KDE file manager (Dolphin) and the KDE
kio-5: file dialog also use this to provide network-enabled file management.
kio-5: It supports accessing files locally as well as via HTTP and FTP out of
kio-5: the box and can be extended by plugins to support other protocols as
kio-5: well. There are a variety of plugins available, e.g. to support access
kio-5: via SSH.
