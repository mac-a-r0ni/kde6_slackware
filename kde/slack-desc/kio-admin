# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

kio-admin: kio-admin (administrative file access KIO)
kio-admin:
kio-admin: kio-admin implements a new protocol `admin:///` which gives
kio-admin: administrative access to the entire system. This is achieved by
kio-admin: talking, over dbus, with a root-level helper binary that in turn uses
kio-admin: existing KIO infrastructure to run file:// operations in root-scope.
kio-admin: Or simply put: `admin://` is exactly like `file://` but redirected
kio-admin: over dbus to gain administrative privileges.
