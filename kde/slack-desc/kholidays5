# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kholidays-5: The KHolidays library in kdepimlibs provides details on public
kholidays-5: holidays for a given country and date range. A separate library and
kholidays-5: file format is required as iCalendar is not capable of expressing
kholidays-5: recurrence rules for all possible holidays.
