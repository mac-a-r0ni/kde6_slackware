# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xwaylandvideobridge: By design, X11 applications can't access window or screen contents
xwaylandvideobridge: for wayland clients. This is fine in principle,
xwaylandvideobridge: but it breaks screen sharing in tools like Discord,
xwaylandvideobridge: MS Teams, Skype, etc and more.
xwaylandvideobridge: XWayland Video Bridge allows us to share specific windows to
xwaylandvideobridge: X11 clients, but within the control of the user at all times.
