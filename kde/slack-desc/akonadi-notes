# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

akonadi-notes:
akonadi-notes: Akonadi Notes is a library that effectively bridges the type-agnostic
akonadi-notes: API of the Akonadi client libraries and the domain-specific KMime
akonadi-notes: library. It provides a helper class for note attachments and for
akonadi-notes: wrapping notes into KMime::Message objects.
