# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kwindowsystem5: kwindowsystem5 (windowing system access)
kwindowsystem5:
kwindowsystem5: KWindowSystem provides information about the windowing system and
kwindowsystem5: allows interaction with the windowing system. It provides a high level
kwindowsystem5: API which is windowing system independent and has platform specific
kwindowsystem5: implementations. This API is inspired by X11 and thus not all
kwindowsystem5: functionality is available on all windowing systems.
