# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kcompletion5: kcompletion5 (Powerful completion framework)
kcompletion5:
kcompletion5: When typing filenames, email addresses and other text where the user
kcompletion5: often wants to select from existing data (including what they
kcompletion5: previously typed) rather than enter anything wholly original, users
kcompletion5: often find it helpful if they only need to type the first few
kcompletion5: characters, and then have the application offer them a set of choices
kcompletion5: or attempt to finish off what they were typing. This framework helps
kcompletion5: implement this in Qt-based applications.
