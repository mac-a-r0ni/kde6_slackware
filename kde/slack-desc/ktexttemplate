# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ktexttemplate: ktexttemplate (separate document structure from data)
ktexttemplate:
ktexttemplate: The goal of KTextTemplate is to make it easier for application
ktexttemplate: developers to separate the structure of documents from the data
ktexttemplate: they contain, opening the door for theming and advanced
ktexttemplate: generation of other text such as code.
ktexttemplate: The syntax uses the syntax of the Django template system,
ktexttemplate: and the core design of Django is reused in KTextTemplate.
