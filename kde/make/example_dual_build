# The previous cmake left us in cmake-build-qt5,
# so we build and install Qt5 support first:
make $NUMJOBS || make || exit 1
make install DESTDIR=$PKG || exit 1

# Go back to cmake-build-qt6 and build/install the Qt6 support:
cd ..
cd cmake-build-qt6
make $NUMJOBS || make || exit 1
make install DESTDIR=$PKG || exit 1
